# Causal Inference Reading Group

## Purpose

There is a lot going on in the causal inference literature! The goal of the reading group is to help each other keep up with the literature and best practices. It will be practitioner-oriented. Ideally, each session will end with people learning something that they can realistically apply to a project.

## Structure

[I have no idea what I'm doing](https://i.imgur.com/m0w03xj.jpg) so happy for suggestions and to adapt as we go along. 

- Once a month
- 1 person leads discussion
- Focus on one paper (or one set of papers around a topic)
- Guide for discussion: 
    1. What is the core methodological issue?
    1. 1-2 examples to illustrate
    1. What are possible solutions?
    1. How to implement solutions *in code*?

About the last point, the goal is NOT that people should be coding up fancy estimators on their own. "Code" here is more like "how can I implement this in Stata/R/Python/Gretl" without too much pain. How hard is it to actually implement what the paper is suggesting on an actual dataset beyond the ones used in the paper? In an ideal world, the discussant would have attempted this (either on simulated or real dataset) and can say something meaningful about the practicalities of implementation. 

### Choosing topics
